## Design
### Colours
The website was designed to be simple but stylish, the site implements multiple images and forms so use of fonting and color was kept minimal so as not to overload the pages.
Dark grey themes were used for the header and footer with a white background set to the main body of the page. White font color was used against the grey backgrounds and black against the white backgrounds. All pages were tested and validated for contrast.

### Fonts
The fonts selected were Josefin Sans with sans-serif as a backup, sourced from Google Fonts.

### Structure
#### Website Pages
The site was designed to be clearly presented and easy to navigate with a uniform header containing navigation links and footer containing social media links.

- The site consists of the following pages:
  - Homepage featuring images of the restaurant and food available, and a short introduction.
  - Tapas Menu and Drinks Menu pages featuring all menu items with descriptions and prices.
  - Blog page with a list view of blog posts.
  - Expanded blog view displays a post the user has selected so they can read the blog, if they are logged in they can also like and leave a comment which will then need to be approved before it is displayed.
